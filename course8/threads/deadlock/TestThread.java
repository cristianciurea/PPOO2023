package ro.ase.course8.threads.deadlock;

// Deadlock describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other.
// Deadlock occurs when multiple threads need the same locks but obtain them in different order.
// A Java multithreaded program may suffer from the deadlock condition because the synchronized keyword causes
// the executing thread to block while waiting for the lock, or monitor, associated with the specified object.
